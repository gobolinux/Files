[Description] Python is an interpreted, interactive,
object-oriented programming language. It combines
remarkable power with very clear syntax, and isn't
difficult to learn. It has modules, classes,
exceptions, very high level data types, and
dynamic typing. There are interfaces to many
system calls and libraries, as well as to various
windowing systems (Tk, Mac, MFC, GTK+, Qt,
wxWindows). New built-in modules are easily
written in C or C++. Python is also usable as an
extension language for applications that need a
programmable interface.
