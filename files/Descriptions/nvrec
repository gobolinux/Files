[Description] NewVideoRecorder is a high quality video capture toolkit for Linux. It includes deep buffering of audio and video to reduce frame dropping, a smooth dropping algorithm to keep the video smooth if dropping is required, and dynamic stretching of the audio stream to exactly match the video stream. It can use v4l1 and v4l2 devices as video sources, and OSS devices as an audio source. It can produce QuickTime, AVI, NuppelVideo 0.52 files, MPEG-1 files, and all files supported by ffmpeg (through the ffmpeg library). It also includes tools and utilities for high quality video streaming (multicast and unicast).
