[Name] Mozilla
[Summary] A Web browser for X11.
[License] Mozilla Public License (MPL)
[Description] Mozilla is a Web browser that is being developed by the Free Software Community with the cooperation and support of Netscape. The current Mozilla is a completely new software based on the "NGLayout" layout engine and runs on almost all current operating systems. Mozilla's user interface is written on top of NGLayout using XUL and JavaScript.  The Mozilla project only develops and tests the source code for other projects / companies to use. Netscape 6 (the Web browser from Netscape) and Beonex Communicator (an open-source project to make a Mozilla for end-users) are directly based on Mozilla. Many other projects use/embed Mozilla's rendering engine (e.g., Galeon).
