[Description] UnZip will list, test, or extract files from a ZIP archive, commonly found on DOS and Windows systems. A companion program, Zip, creates ZIP archives. Both programs are compatible with archives created by PKWARE's PKZIP or Nico Mak's WinZip, but in many cases the program options or default behaviors differ.
