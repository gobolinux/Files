[Description] The ANSI/ISO C++ specifcation includes a standard
C++ library, also known as the STL. GCC by default
comes with an implementation that does not comply
with this standard, but instead partly implements
an older version.  STLport is freely available
version, based on the SGI STL implementation. It
is fully-compliant, supported, and very fast.
Includes special debugging facilities, and
interesting and useful extensions to the standard.
