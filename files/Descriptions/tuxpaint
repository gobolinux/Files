[Description] Tux Paint is a simple and entertaining drawing  
program geared towards young children. It 
has  a simple interface, sound effects, and a  
cartoon character (Tux, the Linux penguin).  
Along with drawing brush strokes, lines and  
shapes, you can also enter text and  
place "rubber stamp" (or "sticker") images on  
the picture. Tux Paint is extensible, and could  
be useful in an educational environment 
(such  as a grammar, elementary, or grade 
school).  It's portable across numerous 
platforms, and  runs well even on slower 
systems like the  Pentium 133MHz.
