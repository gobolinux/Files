[Description] atool is a script for managing file archives of
various types (tar, tar+gzip, zip, etc). The main
command is probably 'aunpack' which extracts files
from an archive. It overcomes the dreaded
"multiple files in archive root" problem by first
extracting to a unique subdirectory, and then
moving back the files if possible. aunpack also
prevents local files from being overwritten by
mistake.  Other commands provided are apack (for
creating archives), als (for listing files in
archives), and acat (for extracting files to stdout).
