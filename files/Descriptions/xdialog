[Description] Xdialog is designed to be a drop-in 
replacement for the dialog and cdialog 
programs. It converts any terminal-based 
program into a program with an X interface. 
The dialogs are easier to see and use, and 
Xdialog adds more functionality such as a help 
button and box, a treeview, an editbox, file and 
directory selectors, a range box, and a 
calendar. It uses GTK+, and will match your 
desktop theme.
