[Description] fsv, the 3D File System Visualizer, allows you to view a collection of directories and files as three-dimensional geometry. It represents all or part of a filesystem as a collection of blocks of varying sizes, each labeled with a filename, and arranged in a manner consistent with the original directory structure. fsv can visualize any arbitrarily large collection of files, limited only by memory and hardware constraints. Program features include an integrated 2D interface, intelligent camera handling, and extensive use of animation. fsv requires OpenGL.
