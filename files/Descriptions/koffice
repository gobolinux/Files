[Description] KOffice is an integrated office suite based on the KDE libraries. KOffice currently includes KWord, KSpread, KPresenter, KChart, Karbon14, KFormula, Kugar, and Kivio. There are no special mail and news clients included in KOffice, because there are KMail and KNode available for KDE anyway. All KOffice components work together, and you can embed every KOffice component into any other KOffice component. This is realized using the KParts object model.
