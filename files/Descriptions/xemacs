[Description] XEmacs (formerly known as Lucid Emacs) is a powerful, extensible text editor with full GUI support, initially based on an early version of GNU Emacs 19 from the Free Software Foundation and since kept up to ate with recent versions of that product. XEmacs stems from a collaboration of Lucid, Inc. with Sun Microsystems, Inc. and the University of Illinois with additional support having been provided by Amdahl Corporation, INS Engineering Corporation, and a huge amount of volunteer effort.
