[Summary]  3D Networked Multi-Player Tank Battle Game
[Description]  BZFlag is a 3D multi-player tank battle game that allows users to play against each other in a networked environment. Since it makes heavy use of 3D graphics (OpenGL), a fast CPU or a supported 3D video card is heavily recommended. Server maps can be found in /usr/share/games/bzflag/maps.
