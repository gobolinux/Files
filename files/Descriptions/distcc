[Description] distcc is a parallel build system that distributes compilation of C/C++/ObjC code across machines on a network. It can be set up in just a few minutes and makes builds up to ten times faster. It does not require machines to share a filesystem or have the same libraries or header files, and installation does not need superuser privileges.
