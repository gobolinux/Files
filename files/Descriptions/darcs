[Description] Darcs is an advanced revision control system along the lines of CVS or arch.  It has two particularly distinctive features which differ from other revision control systems: each copy of the source is a fully functional branch, and underlying it is a consistent and powerful theory of patches.  In spite of its power, darcs is simple to use, in part because of the symmetry that is restored by making each copy of the repository a branch.
