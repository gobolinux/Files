[Description] WvDial (pronounced "Weave Dial") is an easier way to connect to the internet. It completely avoids the need for chat scripts, edits pap-secrets and chap-secrets for you, detects your modem automatically, and chooses a valid init string. It can even read and respond to command prompts at almost any ISP.
