[Description] DeleGate is a multi-purpose application level gateway, or a proxy server which runs on multiple platforms (Unix, Windows, Mac OS X, and OS/2). DeleGate mediates communication of various protocols (HTTP, FTP, NNTP, SMTP, POP, Telnet, SOCKS, etc.), applying cache and conversion for mediated data, controlling access from clients and routing toward servers. It translates protocols between clients and servers, applying SSL(TLS) to arbitrary protocols, merging several servers into a single server view with aliasing and filtering. Born as a tiny proxy for Gopher in March 1994, it has steadily grown into a general purpose proxy server. Besides proxy, DeleGate can be used as a simple origin server for some protocols (HTTP, FTP, and NNTP).
