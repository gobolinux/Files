[Name]  gl-117
[Summary]  Action Flight Simulator
[Description]  This air combat game comes with background music, beautiful generated landscapes, a tutorial, and many missions to play. It supports keyboard, mouse, and joystick. It is tuned for maximum performance and a Celeron 333 Mhz with a Matrox MGA 400 (390 frames per second for glxgears) is more than enough, but better cards are also supported and provide better detail.
