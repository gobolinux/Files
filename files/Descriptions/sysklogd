[Description] The sysklogd package implements two system log
daemons. The syslogd daemon is an enhanced version
of the standard Berkeley utility program. It is
responsible for providing logging of messages
received from programs and facilities on the local
host as well as from remote hosts. The klogd
daemon listens to kernel message sources and is
responsible for prioritizing and processing
operating system messages. It can run as a client
of syslogd or optionally as a standalone program.
Klogd can be used to decode EIP addresses if it
can find a System.map file.
