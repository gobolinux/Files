[Description] Lam merges several input files line-by-line. By
changing the input or output line separators you
can do fun things like interleaving lines from
several files or making a simple template system. 
Lam can also pad or truncate input lines to given
widths before merging. Lam is often distributed
together with jot and rs (sometimes under the name
bsd-utils).
