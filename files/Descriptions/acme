[Description] ACME is a small GNOME tool to make use of the
multimedia buttons present on most laptops and
Internet keyboards: Volume, Brightness, Power,
Eject, My Home, Search, E-Mail, Sleep,
Screensaver, Finance, WWW, Calculator, Record,
Close Window, Shade Window, Play, Stop, Pause,
Previous, Next, Groups, Media, Refresh, and Help
buttons.  It works on all the platforms GNOME
supports (laptops and PCs). It uses either OSS or
ALSA for Volume control.
