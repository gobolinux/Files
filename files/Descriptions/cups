[Description] CUPS provides a portable printing layer for Unix(r)-based operating systems. It has been developed to promote a standard printing solution for all Unix vendors and users. CUPS provides the System V and Berkeley command line interfaces, and uses the Internet Printing Protocol ("IPP") as the basis for managing print jobs and queues. The Line Printer Daemon (LPD) Server Message Block (SMB), and AppSocket (a.k.a. JetDirect) protocols are also supported with reduced functionality. CUPS adds network printer browsing and PostScript Printer Description ("PPD") based printing options to support real world printing under UNIX.  It includes an image file RIP that supports printing of image files to non-PostScript printers. A customized version of GNU Ghostscript 7.05 for CUPS called ESP Ghostscript is available separately to support printing of PostScript files within the CUPS driver framework. Sample drivers for Dymo, EPSON, HP, and OKIDATA printers are included that use these filters.
