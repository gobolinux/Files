[Summary] LGPL'd re-implementation of Motif
[License] GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL)
[Description] LessTif is an LGPL'd implemention of the OSF/Motif standard GUI toolkit for X11. LessTif aims to be source compatible with the OSF/Motif versions 1.2 and 2.1. Currently 1.2 support is almost complete and most Motif 1.2 apps should compile and run out of the box, whilst 2.1 still has very little functionality.
