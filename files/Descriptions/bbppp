[Description] Bbppp is a minimalist PPP dialer designed for use with the Blackbox window manager (though it should be usable with any X wm). While it is minimalist in that it takes up very little screen real estate, it is highly configurable. It also has a throughput rate window, which shows Kb/s transfer over the PPP link in realtime.
