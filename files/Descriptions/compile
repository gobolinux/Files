[Name] Compile
[Summary] GoboLinux compilation system
[License] GNU General Public License (GPL)
[Description] 
Compile downloads source tarballs, unpacks, compiles and installs them, with a single command, using simple 
compilation scripts called "recipes". Compile was introduced in GoboLinux 011, but already features a considerable 
(and ever-growing) number of recipes, and is able to compile all kinds of software, including Glibc, GCC, KDE and the 
Linux kernel.
