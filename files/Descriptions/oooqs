[Description] OpenOffice.org Quickstarter is a small application
that runs in the KDE SystemTray.  It is used to
quickly start the different OpenOffice.org modules
without having to go through the K-Menu.  Instead
of just starting of applications, you can also
select multiple files in the usual opendialog
provided by KDE to open them in OpenOffice.org,
use a history of recently opened files, configure
the app to do one of the above described functions
on a simple double click, and use the app to keep
a hidden instance of OpenOffice.org in memory to
achieve much shorter startup times of the
OpenOffice.org modules.
