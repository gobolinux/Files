[Description] libbadpenguin is a small static library used in
many utilities that are part of the "Bad Penguin"
GNU/Linux distribution. It provides functions to
manage the filesystem, doubly-linked lists
(chains), the terminal (cursor and color), and to
handle TAR archives (including functionality
missing from GNU tar, such as progress bars). The
goal of libbadpenguin is to speed up the
development of console tools and utilities without
requiring big static libraries such as "ncurses"
or "GNU glib". It is intended to be as small as
possibile in order to be linked statically to
avoid dependency problems.
