[Description] Filelight graphically represents a file system as
a set of concentric segmented rings, aiming to
show where diskspace is being used. Segments
expand from the center, representing files and
directories. The size of segments is proportional
to the size of the files they represent.
Directories have child segments which represent
the files they contain. Filelight performs a
similar function to the command line tool du, but
all the information is shown in a compact
graphical fashion.
