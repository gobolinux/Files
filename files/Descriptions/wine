[Summary] Emulator of the Windows 3.x and Win32 APIs.

[Description] Wine Is Not an Emulator. It is an alternative
implementation of the Windows 3.x and Win32 APIs.
Wine provides both a development toolkit (Winelib)
for porting legacy Windows sources to Unix and a
program loader, allowing unmodified Windows
3.1/95/NT binaries to run under Intel Unixes. Wine
does not require Microsoft Windows, as it is a
completely alternative implementation consisting
of 100% Microsoft-Free code, but it can optionally
use native system DLLs if they are available.
