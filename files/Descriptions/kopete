[Name] Kopete
[Summary] A plugin-based multi-protocol instant messenger for KDE
[License] GNU General Public License (GPL)
[Description] Kopete is a flexible and extendable multiple protocol instant messaging system designed as a plugin-based system. All protocols are plugins and allow modular installation, configuration, and usage without the main application knowing anything about the plugin being loaded. The goal of Kopete is to provide users with a standard and easy to use interface between all of their instant messaging systems, but at the same time also providing developers with the ease of writing plugins to support a new protocol. The core Kopete development team provides a handful of plugins that most users can use, in addition to templates for new developers to base a plugin on.
