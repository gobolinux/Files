[Summary]  An MPEG audio decoder library
[Description]  MAD is a high-quality MPEG audio decoder. It currently supports MPEG-1 and the MPEG-2 extension to Lower Sampling Frequencies, as well as the so-called MPEG 2.5 format. All three audio layers (Layer I, Layer II, and Layer III a.k.a. MP3) are fully implemented. MAD supports high quality 24-bit PCM output for modern audio technologies. MAD computes using 100% fixed-point (integer) computation, so you can run it without a floating point unit.
