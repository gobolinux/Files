[Summary]  Nessus Scripting Language Library
[Description]  A powerful security scanner. This scanner consists of a daemon, nessusd, to be started on a machine close to the one to be tested, and a graphical front-end, nessus, which can be run on a different machine and can connect to the daemon. You can do various security checks (currently more than 900) and get a report of possible weaknesses or vulnerabilities which were found on the target host.
