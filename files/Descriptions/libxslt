[Description] Libxslt is a C library for GNOME which allows developers to work with XSLT. It is based on libxml for XML parsing, tree manipulation, and XPath support. Also included is 'xsltproc', a command line XSLT processor. The library is written in plain C, making as few assumptions as possible, and sticking closely to ANSI C/POSIX for easy embedding. It should work on Linux, Unix, and Windows. Though not designed primarily with performances in mind, libxslt seems to be a relatively fast processor. It also include full support for the EXSLT set of extension functions as well as some common extensions present in other XSLT engines.
