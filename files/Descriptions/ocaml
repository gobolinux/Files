[Description] Objective Caml is the latest implementation of the Caml dialect of ML. It has full support for objects and classes combined with ML-style type reconstruction, a powerful module calculus in the style of Standard ML (but retaining separate compilation), a high-performance native code compiler (in addition to a Caml Light-style bytecode compiler), and labeled arguments with possible default value.
