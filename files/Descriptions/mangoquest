[Description] The Blue Mango Quest is a 3D arcade game that 
uses OpenGL and SDL. The goal is to extend the 
pacman-style gameplay in several ways. You see 
what the main character sees (like in traditional 
FPS games), and you'll find about 20 items (bonus 
and malus) that will give you a lot of fun. An easy 
to use yet powerfull 2D level editor is also provided.
