[Description] Ion is a tiling (no overlapping windows) window
manager that also has PWM-style tabbed frames
which can contain multiple client windows. These
features help to keep windows organized and to
switch quickly between them. Ion was designed
primarily as an efficient and unobtrusive window
manager for users who prefer the keyboard.
