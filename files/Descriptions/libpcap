[Name] libpcap
[Summary] A system-independent interface for user-level packet capture.
[License] BSD License (original)
[Description] This is a handy little library which provides a
packet filtering mechanism based on the BSD packet
filter (BPF). Most notably, tcpdump needs this to
work, and there is also a perl module (still in
beta) which can use this as well. In plain
english, if you want to write your own network
traffic analyzer, this is the place to start.
