[Description] Pekwm is a window manager based on aewm++, but it no longer resembles it. It is highly configurable, rather fast, and aimed towards being usable while remaining pretty enough to look at. Features include client window grouping into one window frame, automatic window size, location, grouping and title rewriting properties, keychains, Xinerama support, pixmap theming, and dynamic menus.
