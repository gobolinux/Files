[Description] Tcsh is an enhanced but completely compatible version of the Berkeley UNIX C shell. It is a command language interpreter usable both as an interactive login shell and a shell script command processor. It includes a command line editor, programmable word completion, command and file name completion, listing, spelling correction, a history mechanism, job control, and a bunch of small additions to the csh shell itself.
