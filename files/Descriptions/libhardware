[Description] libhardware is a very small static library used in many utilities that are part of the "Bad Penguin" distribution. It provides functions to access information about your system hardware, to detect the hardware, and to handle kernel modules automatically. It is able to enumerate all PCI devices, enumerate all EIDE disks and CDROMs, enumerate all SCSI disks and CDROMs,  enumerate all EIDE/SCSI disk partitions, and check if a detected device is supported in the Linux kernel using a custom PCI database. It can also handle USB devices. The included shell scripts 'probedisk' and 'probepart' detect disks, CDROMs, and partitions. The included 'scanmodule' utility allows you to detect devices and load their kernel modules automatically.
