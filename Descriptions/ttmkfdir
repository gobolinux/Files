[Description] ttmkfdir is a tool to create valid and complete fonts.dir files from TrueType fonts. It is very useful when you plan to use a TrueType enabled font server that is based on the X11R6 sample implementation (xfsft for instance). Great care has been taken to correctly identify the encodings that a given TrueType font supports.
