[Description] The rlpr package makes it possible (or at the very least, easier) to print files on remote sites to your local printer. It includes BSD-compatible replacements for `lpr', `lpq', and `lprm', whose functionality is a superset of their BSD counterparts. In other words, with the rlpr package, you can do everything you could do with the BSD printing commands, and more. The programs are all smaller, cleaner, and more portable than their BSD equivalents, and supported on just about any POSIX.1 system.
