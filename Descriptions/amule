[Description] aMule is short for "another eMule file-sharing program". It's a port of the well-known eMule P2P client for the eDonkey2000 file sharing network, supporting most of eMule features. Additionally, it provides a small separate Web server and command line interface to connect to a running aMule via the network. Like its predecessors lMule and xMule, it uses wxWidgets and runs on Linux, BSD, and Solaris. Win32 and Mac ports are in progress.
