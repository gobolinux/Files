[Description] aee is a text editor that is intended to be usable with little or no instruction. It provides both a terminal (curses based) interface and native X-Windows interface (in which case the executable is called xae). Features include pop-up menus, journalling (to recover from system crash or loss of connection), cut-and-paste, multiple buffers (associated with files or not), and much more.
