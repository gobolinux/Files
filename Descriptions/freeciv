[Description] Freeciv is a multiuser reimplementation for Unix/X of the famous Microprose game of Civilization. By default, the game is an improved Civ II, but this can be customized; modpacks for near-100% compatibility with Civ I and Civ II are included.  Multiuser gameplay is real-time: in each turn, all human players move concurrently. The game is designed to remain fairly playable even on poor network connections. Freeciv can also be played on standalone machines, and its AI players are a good challenge for beginners.  The source code comes with the server, two X clients, and non-X clients for MS Windows and Amiga.  Freeciv is released under the GNU General Public License. It is maintained by an international team of coders and enthusiasts, and is easily one of the most fun and addictive network games out there.
