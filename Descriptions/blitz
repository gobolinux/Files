[Description] Blitz++ library moves high-level optimizations out of 
compilers and into libraries in C++. It was created 
due to the fact that until recently, C++ lagged 
behind Fortran's performance by anywhere from 
20% to a factor of ten. The C++ programming 
language offers many features useful for tackling 
complex scientific computing problems, but 
unfortunately, these advanced features came with 
this hefty performance pricetag. This program 
presents a possible solution.
