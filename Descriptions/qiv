[Description] Quick Image Viewer (qiv) is a very small and fast
GDK/Imlib image viewer designed to replace the
classic image viewers like xv or xloadimage. It
features setting an image as an X11 background
with a user-definable background color, fullscreen
viewing, a screensaver mode,
brightness/contrast/gamma correction, real
transparency, zoom, slideshow, support for
external programs, and more. It runs on Linux
(libc5/glibc), Solaris (SunOS), FreeBSD, and
HP-UX.
