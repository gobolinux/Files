[Description] Ruby is a language for quick and easy programming. Similar in scope to Perl and Python, it has high-level data types, automatic memory management, dynamic typing, a module system, exceptions, and a rich standard library. What sets Ruby apart is a clean and consistent language design where everything is an object. Other distinguishing features are CLU-style iterators for loop abstraction, singleton classes/methods and lexical closures.
