[License] GNU General Public License (GPL) 
[Description] Manager is a PyQt based frontend that makes it easier to manage
the packages of a GoboLinux system. The user can install packages, compile
recipes, remove programs and the like without having to deal directly with 
the backend scripts. The implementations of Manager itself is kept only as front-end, 
in the way that it does not reimplement logic from the GoboLinux Scripts package and 
new funcionalities that are independent from the graphical interface were 
placed in independent scripts.
