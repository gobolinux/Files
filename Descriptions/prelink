[Name]  prelink
[Summary]  An ELF Prelinking Utility
[Description]  The prelink program is a utility that modifies shared libraries and executables in the ELF format so that far less relocations need to be resolved at run time. This decreases program start-up time. You can enable prelink support via the YaST sysconfig editor or in /etc/sysconfig/prelink. Be aware that prelink modifies all libraries and executables on your system. Applications which monitor changes in files will no longer work.
