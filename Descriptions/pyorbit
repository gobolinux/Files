[Description] PyORBit is a Python binding for the ORBit2 CORBA ORB.  It was developped to suit the needs of the bonobo bindings in GNOME-Python, but is usable for other purposes as well.  It aims to follow the standard Python language mapping for CORBA.  It can generate stubs at runtime from typelibs, IDL files, or by introspecting remote objects using ORBit2's IModule typelib capabilities.
