[Description] WMCPULoad is a program to monitor CPU usage. It is a dockapp that is supported by X window managers such as Window Maker, AfterStep, BlackBox, and Enlightenment. It dispalys the current usage, expressed as a percentile and a chart, and has an LCD look-alike user interface. The back light may be turned on/off by clicking the mouse button over the application. If the CPU usage hits a certain threshold, an alarm-mode will alert you by turning the back light on.
