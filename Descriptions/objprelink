[Description] Object Prelinking for C++ object files is used
after the C++ compiler and before the C++ linker.
It transforms .o files, trying to replace
expensive relocations by cheaper ones. This leads
to less work for the dynamical loader, providing
faster startups in large C++ applications.  It is
useful for speeding up KDE and QT.
