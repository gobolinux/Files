[Description] GTK Theme Switch is a small and fast command line utility to switch GTK themes on the fly. It also has an optional GUI to preview the requested theme and change the font used with it, an optional GUI dock, and it can install themes downloaded from gtk.themes.org, preview them, or switch to them immediately.
