[Name]  libxml2
[Summary]  A library to manipulate XML files
[Description]  The XML C library was initially developed for the Gnome project. It is now used by many programs to load and save extensible datastructures or to manipulate any kind of XML files. This library implements a number of existing standards related to markup languages, including the XML standard, namespaces in XML, XML Base, RFC 2396, XPath, XPointer, HTML4, XInclude, SGML Catalogs, and XML Catalogs. In most cases, libxml tries to implement the specification in a rather strict way. To some extent, it provides support for the following specifications, but doesn't claim to implement them: DOM, FTP client, HTTP client, SAX, and DocBook SGML. The library also supports RelaxNG; support for W3C XML Schemas is in progress.
