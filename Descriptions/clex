[Description] CLEX is a file manager with a full-screen user
interface written in C with the curses library. It
displays directory contents (including file status
details) and provides features like command
history, filename insertion, or name completion in
order to help the user to construct commands to be
executed by the shell (there are no built-in
commands). CLEX is easily configurable and all its
features are explained in the on-line help.
