[Description] DirectFB is a thin library that provides 
developers with hardware graphics 
acceleration, input device handling and 
abstraction, an integrated windowing system 
with support for translucent windows and 
multiple display layers on top of the Linux 
framebuffer device. It is a complete hardware 
abstraction layer with software fallbacks for 
every graphics operation that is not 
supported by the underlying hardware.
