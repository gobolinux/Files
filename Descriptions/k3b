[Description] K3b is a CD and DVD burning application for Linux systems optimized for KDE. It provides a comfortable user interface to perform most CD/DVD burning tasks, such as creating an audio CD from a set of audio files or copying a CD. While the experienced user can influence all steps of the burning process, the beginner may find comfort in the automatic settings and the reasonable defaults which allow a quick start. The actual burning is done by the command line utilities cdrecord, cdrdao, and growisofs.
