[Name] MS CHM library
[Summary] A library for reading Microsoft .CHM files.
[License] GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL)
[Description] Microsoft help files and technical documentation
have been distributed in "compressed HTML" format
for several years now. The documentation itself
is, obviously, in HTML, and so would be useful on
other platforms than Windows. chmlib makes it
possible to write software that accesses the Web
content stored in the file, either to extract or
merely to view.
