[Description] NapShare is a fully-automated Gnutella P2P client, made to run unattended. Supply a list of keywords and it will download overnight, also sharing whatever it gets. It has a full GUI using GTK with all the features you would expect from a Gnutella client. All file types are on Gnutella, including MP3, MPG, JPG, TXT, AVI, and more. It interoperates with BearShare, Gnucleus, LimeWire, and others.
