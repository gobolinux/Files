[Description] Gnome System Monitor is a GNOME process viewer and
system monitor with a nice easy-to-use interface,
It has some nice features, such as a tree view for
process dependencies, icons for processes, the
ability to hide processes that you don't want to
see, graphical time histories of CPU/memory/swap
usage, the ability to kill/renice processes
needing root access, as well as the standard
features that you might expect from a process viewer.
