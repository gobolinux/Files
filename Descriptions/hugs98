[Name]  hugs98
[Summary]  A Haskell interpreter
[Description]  Hugs is a Haskell interpreter and programming environment for developing cool Haskell programs. This release is largely conformant with Haskell 98, including monad and record syntax, newtypes, strictness annotations, and modules. In addition, it comes packaged with the libraries defined in the most recent version of the Haskell Library Report and with extension libraries which are compatible with GHC 3.0 and later. Hugs is best used as a Haskell program development system: it boasts extremely fast compilation, supports incremental compilation, and has the convenience of an interactive interpreter (within which one can move from module to module to test different portions of a program). However, being an interpreter, it does not nearly match the run-time performance of, for example, GHC or HBC.
