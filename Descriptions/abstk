[Name] AbsTK
[Summary] A python Abtract Toolkit for interface building
[Description]
Maintaining different versions for an application in text and graphic modes is costly and problematic. AbsTK is a free Python toolkit for interface building, which abstracts away the visual elements and allows one to develop applications which execute both in textual and graphical environments. 
It currently supports the Unix console through ncurses and X11 through Qt, and is released under the GNU GPL.
