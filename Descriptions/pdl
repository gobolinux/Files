[Description] The PerlDL project aims to turn Perl into an efficient numerical language for scientific computing. The PDL module gives standard Perl the ability to compactly store and speedily manipulate the large N-dimensional data sets which are the bread and butter of scientific computing. e.g. $a=$b+$c can add two 2048x2048 images in only a fraction of a second. The aim is to provide tons of useful functionality for scientific and numeric analysis.
