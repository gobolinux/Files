[Description] WvStreams is a library set composed of a number of parts. Among them are WvIPStreams (WvTCPStream and WvUDPStream), WvStrings (yet another C++ String class), WvCrypto Streams (including an easy way to add SSL support to applications), WvConf (a configuration file handler), WvLog (nice, simple handling of log files), and a whole host of other goodness. These are the base classes used to build programs such as the ever popular WvDial, TunnelVision, FastForward, KWvDial, and retchmail.
