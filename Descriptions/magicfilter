[Description] magicfilter is an extensible and customizable
automatic printer filter. It selects an
appropriate conversion technique for the input
data by seeking for magic numbers, and then
utilizing the appropriate conversion utility. It
is primarily intended for use as the "input
filter" by the lpd print spooler. The options
accepted by magicfilter are exactly the ones
passed to the input filter by lpd.
